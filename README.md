# Task 2 – Bank Customer Churn Prediction  
Future Interns – Machine Learning Internship  

This project predicts customer churn using machine learning models and provides an interactive dashboard built using Streamlit.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses:
- Bank Customer Churn Dataset  
- Machine Learning Models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost)  
- Complete EDA + Feature Engineering  
- SHAP Explainability  
- Model Evaluation (ROC-AUC, F1, PR Curve)  
- Streamlit dashboard deployment  

The dashboard allows users to upload their own dataset or make predictions manually.
