This project uses Machine Learning to predict whether a bank customer will churn (leave the bank) based on demographic and account-related features. I trained a classification model using Random Forest, performed data cleaning, encoding, feature engineering, and deployed the model as a Streamlit-based Churn Prediction Dashboard.
